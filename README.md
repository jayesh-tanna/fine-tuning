# Fine-Tuning in AI Foundry
This repository contains both end-to-end worked examples of fine-tuning in AI Foundry and a collection of sample datasets. Use this repo to explore practical fine-tuning workflows and access ready-to-use data for your own projects.

## Data sets
This repository contains a collection of sample datasets that can be used to test and validate various customization techniques on the [Azure AI Foundry](http://ai.azure.com/). These are curated datasets created from various public HuggingFace datasets. By running a demo, you consent to the download of a third-party dataset. In no event will Microsoft be liable for any damages arising from your use of these datasets.

### Purpose of these datasets

- These datasets are meant to be used as a **reference** to understand how to prepare training/validation data to run finetuning and other customization jobs on the [Azure AI Foundry](http://ai.azure.com/). Do not consider these samples as complete datasets for production use.
- These datasets can be used for experimental runs, and to check the end-to-end flows while running customization jobs on the [Azure AI Foundry](http://ai.azure.com/). Note, that any training jobs can incur costs on the subscription.

## Demos
These demos showcase features or end-to-end experiences related to fine-tuning in AI Foundry.
